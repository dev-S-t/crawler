Subject: Internship Challenge Submission - Web Data Extraction - Sahil Tomar

Dear Hiring Team,

Please find attached my submission for the Web Data Extraction Internship Challenge.

**Deliverables Included:**
1.  **Standalone Engine (`crawler.py`):** A 55KB production-ready script with a 6-layer extraction pipeline (Network → DOM → LLM → Vision).
2.  **Project Report:** Detailed architectural breakdown of the solution.
3.  **Demo Outputs:** Clean, structured JSON from three complex sources:
    *   **Worldometers** (Real-time JS & Charts)
    *   **Moneycontrol** (Nested Financial Tables)
    *   **Punjab Transport** (Scanned PDF Timetables)

**Key Innovations:**
*   **Source-Agnostic:** Adapts to content type rather than relying on brittle CSS selectors.
*   **Visual Intelligence:** Successfully extracts data from charts and image-based PDFs using Vision AI.
*   **Graceful Degradation:** Core extraction features work even without an API key.

I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Sahil Tomar
